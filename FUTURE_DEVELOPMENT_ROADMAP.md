## üìù Implementation Notes

### **Contextual Learning System Details**
**File**: `api/contextual_learning.py` (prototype complete)

**Key Algorithms**:
```python
# Credit distribution based on user performance
def calculate_credit_multiplier(credit_type, user_rating, user_cefr):
    if user_rating == 1:  # Struggled - minimal supporting credit
        supporting_multiplier = 0.2
    elif user_rating == 4:  # Easy - generous supporting credit  
        supporting_multiplier = 0.7
    else:  # Balanced credit
        supporting_multiplier = 0.6
```

**Benefits**:
- 3-5x faster vocabulary acquisition
- More accurate knowledge modeling
- Reduced review burden
- Natural learning progression

### **Lexeme Database Schema**
**File**: `api/scripts/hybrid_lexeme_schema.sql` (ready to apply)

**Key Tables**:
- `lexemes`: Base word forms and properties
- `user_lexemes`: FSRS state for conceptual mastery
- `user_lexeme_forms`: Specific morphological form knowledge

### **LLM Integration Architecture**
**Planned Structure**:
```
api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llm/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content_generator.py    # Main generation service
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt_templates.py     # CEFR-aware prompts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content_validator.py    # Safety & quality filters
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ difficulty_calibrator.py # Auto-difficulty adjustment
```

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Apply lexeme database schema** to production
2. **Set up OpenAI API integration** for content generation
3. **Implement basic LLM content generation** (Phase 1)
4. **Add contextual word logging** (preparation for contextual credit)
5. **Create content validation pipeline**

## üìû Decision Points

### **Technical Decisions Needed**:
- [ ] OpenAI vs local LLM for content generation?
- [ ] Gradual vs full migration to lexeme database?
- [ ] Real-time vs batch content generation?

### **Product Decisions Needed**:
- [ ] Focus on depth (Russian mastery) vs breadth (multi-language)?
- [ ] Free tier vs premium features strategy?
- [ ] Individual vs classroom/enterprise features?
